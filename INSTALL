Build Directions:
-----------------

- Build dependency package (optional but recommended):

Run CMake with the source directory set to ./dependencies and the binary
dir set wherever you like, then do a build.  This will download/build all
required dependencies (vrpn, wiiuse, fltk) and install them into
./dependencies/install-prefix

- Build the system

Run CMake with the source dir set to the current directory and the binary
dir set anywhere else (don't re-use the binary dir from the dependency build
above).  Just do a build and either an install or a package!

Quickie Command Line Instructions:
----------------------------------
You may have to adapt these to your circumstances - they are an example only.

git clone https://rpavlik@github.com/rpavlik/wiimote-head-tracker-gui.git
cd wiimote-head-tracker-gui
mkdir build
mkdir deps-build
cd deps-build
cmake ../dependencies
make
cd ../build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/wiimoteheadtracker -DINSTALL_WIIUSE_LIBRARY=ON
make
make install

then to run:

~/wiimoteheadtracker/bin/wiimoteheadtracker

Ubuntu Linux:
