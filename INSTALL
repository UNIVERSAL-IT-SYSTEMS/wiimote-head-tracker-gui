Build Directions:
-----------------

- Build dependency package (optional but recommended):

Run CMake with the source directory set to ./dependencies and the binary
dir set wherever you like, then do a build.  This will download/build all
required dependencies (vrpn, wiiuse, fltk) and install them into
./built-dependencies

- Build the system

Run CMake with the source dir set to the current directory and the binary
dir set anywhere else (don't re-use the binary dir from the dependency build
above).  Just do a build and either an install or a package!

Ubuntu Linux:
To install some dependencies:
sudo aptitude install fluid libfltk1.1-dev
