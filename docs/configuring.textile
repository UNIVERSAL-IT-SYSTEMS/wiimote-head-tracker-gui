h1. Configuring the Tracking Server

Most of the time, the only configuration you might need to adjust is the distance between the LEDs, based on your particular glasses.

* Note: If you save a configuration called "default" (with the extension, "default.headtrackconfig") in the "bin" folder alongside the tracker server, it should be loaded automatically at startup.
