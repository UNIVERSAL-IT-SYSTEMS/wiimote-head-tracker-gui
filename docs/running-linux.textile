h1. Running on Linux

h2.  Start the Tracking Server

If you installed it to ~/headtracker, the command to run will be ~/headtracker/bin/wiimoteheadtracker 

h2. Press 1 and 2 on the Wiimote when prompted

Unlike those poor souls on Windows, you can run the tracker without having to do any kind of Bluetooth pairing with the Wiimote - the application handles everything smoothly for you.
