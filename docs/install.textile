h1. Installing on Linux <a name="Linux"></a>

h2.  Build from source

If you download a source tarball or clone the git repository, you can look at the build instructions.  Right now no Linux binaries are available - sorry!

h1. Installing on Windows <a name="Windows"></a>

h2. Pre-built downloads

<a href="http://github.com/rpavlik/wiimote-head-tracker-gui/downloads">Downloads here!</a>

h3. Which download?

Most users will want the .exe download. It produces Start Menu shortcuts and allows all users of a system to start the tracker (if installed as an administrator).

The .zip is a "portable" version - it contains the same files as the installer, but with no install system, so you can run it from a network share or a USB drive.
