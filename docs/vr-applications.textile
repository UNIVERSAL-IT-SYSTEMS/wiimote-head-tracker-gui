h1. Using With Virtual Reality Applications

The server provides a VRPN7 tracker device, by default named "Tracker0@localhost" from the perspective of a VR application running on the same computer.

* If you're using VR Juggler 2.2.x, you can use the jconf files included with the server to run a full-screen head-tracked environment.
