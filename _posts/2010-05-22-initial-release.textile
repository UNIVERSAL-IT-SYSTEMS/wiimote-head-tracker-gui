We released today v1.0.1 of the tracking server for public availability.  We have provided an installer and a zipped "portable" copy of the server for Windows, as well as full source code compatible with Windows and Linux.

Web documentation for Linux is slim at the moment, but there's plenty of "documentation for Windows":{{site.url}}/docs/install.html , full of screen shots and helpful information!
