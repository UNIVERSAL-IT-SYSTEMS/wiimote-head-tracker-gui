h2. IR Modification for Stereo Glasses

If a stereo vision setup is being used then similar IR tracking is still needed for the setup. You will need:
* 2X LED key chains with an on/off switch
* 2X Wide angle IR LEDs (940 nm will work the best)
* Adhesive backed Velcro
* A pair of stereo glasses


The process is quite similar to that of the one used for the illuminated safety glasses conversion. Instead of using converted glasses LED key chains are used instead because of their small size and relatively small price. Make sure that the key chains aren&#39;t only push button/pressure activated, but have an on/off switch.

As with the safety glasses swap, open the housing of the key chain using a jeweler&#39;s screw driver.  Using the original LED cathode as a reference carefully cut the IR LED cathode to the same length. Insert the IR LED into the housing, replace the batteries, and reinsert the screws. Repeat this process one more time so that you have two LED key chains.

To test whether the conversion was successful a cell phone camera can be used. Turn the switch for the glasses on and look at the LED with the phone&#39;s camera. If the conversion was successful the LED should appear illuminated on the screen of the phone. Likewise, test the LED when the switch is in the off position to ensure that your batteries won&#39;t be wasted while the glasses aren&#39;t in use.

The last step of the process is to attach the key chains to the stereo glasses. Simply attach adhesive backed Velcro to the bows of the glasses and the backs of the key chains. Make sure that the switch is facing out so that they can easily be turned on and off. Also, try to place them as far forward on the bows as possible to ensure the maximum field of view.
